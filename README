Thanks for downloading. This class file wasn't originally mine, but due to the original developer's lack of support, I've decided to take over! 

In your project header, import DSAlertView

wherever you're going to add the custom alert code, be sure to initialize it as: 

[[[DSAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"YOUR_TITLE_HERE" 
                                 message:@"YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE" 
                                delegate:self //this never changes
                       cancelButtonTitle:@"YOUR_BUTTON_TITLE_HERE" 
                       otherButtonTitles:@"OPTIONAL_BUTTON_TITLE",nil] show];
