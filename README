Thanks for downloading. This class file was not originally mine, but I have fixed various objects that were not working with Apple's iOS 5 update.

In your project header, import DSAlertView

wherever you're going to add the custom alert code, be sure to initialize it like this: 

[[[[DSAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"YOUR_TITLE_HERE" 
                                 message:@YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE" 
                                delegate:self //this never changes
                       cancelButtonTitle:@"YOUR_BUTTON_TITLE_HERE" 
                       otherButtonTitles:@"OPTIONAL_BUTTON_TITLE",nil] autorelease] show];
